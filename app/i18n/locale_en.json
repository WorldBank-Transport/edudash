The raw data is published on the Government's open data portal in machine-readable format with a license that encourages re-use. In some cases, the dashboard uses data that are cleaned or merged with other data to create new datasets that are easier for the dashboard to read, but even in these cases the data itself draws exclusively from open data released by the Government of Tanzania.",

    "data.faq-title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "data.faq-q1": "Why do some charts or maps only show data at regional or district level, instead of at lower levels?",
    "data.faq-a1": "This dashboard shows data at the most disaggregated level based on the data that is available on the open data portal. Some datasets on the open data portal only contain data that is aggregated at the region, district, or ward level.",
    "data.faq-q2": "Why do some charts or maps only show old data from last year or before?",
    "data.faq-a2": "This dashboard shows the most recent data that is available on the open data portal. When data for multiple years is published, you can click the “Year” menu option to view data from that year.",
    "data.faq-q3": "I’m looking at a specific visualization on this dashboard. Why can’t I find the exact same raw dataset that is shown in the visualization?",
    "data.faq-a3": "In many cases, some additional data cleaning or manipulation is necessary. For instance, this dashboard shows data like the pass rate, national ranking, and average pupil teacher ratio for districts, but there is no dataset on the open data portal that contains this information. However, all of this data is available; some math – averaging all the pass rates in one district, for example – is required. This dashboard does these calculations in the background, but it always uses the raw data that is publicly available.",
    "data.faq-q4": "Why does it say “Missing Data” in some cases?",
    "data.faq-a4": "The dashboard can say “Missing Data” for a number of reasons. One common reason is because different datasets about similar information might record that information differently. For instance, the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training keeps information about the pupil-teacher ratio in schools, while the National Bureau of Statistics keeps information about the location of schools. Because these are in separate datasets, the two of them must be merged, often by joining the two datasets using a common field (the school name). But if the school name is not recorded identically in both datasets, then the match will not be made and that school’s pupil teacher ratio will not be matched or displayed in this dashboard. ",
